# Project Status Summary - All Critical Issues Resolved ✅

## 🎉 Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

All previously identified critical issues have been successfully resolved. The application is now working correctly.

## ✅ Resolved Issues

### 1. Authentication & Login Redirect ✅
- **Issue**: Users were being redirected to club dashboard regardless of their actual account type
- **Solution**: Enhanced AuthProvider logic to correctly detect account types from role-specific collections
- **Result**: Users now correctly redirect to their appropriate dashboards

### 2. SignOut Function Errors ✅
- **Issue**: Multiple sidebar components were trying to use `signOut` instead of `logout`
- **Solution**: Updated all sidebar components to use the correct `logout` function
- **Files Fixed**: ClubSidebar.jsx, AcademySidebar.jsx, TrainerSidebar.jsx, AgentSidebar.jsx

### 3. Account Debugger Import Error ✅
- **Issue**: Dynamic import causing 404 errors for account debugger
- **Solution**: Simplified the debugger approach with inline conditional debugging
- **Result**: No more import errors, cleaner debugging

### 4. Image Optimization Error ✅
- **Issue**: Next.js Image component causing 500 errors with Supabase URLs
